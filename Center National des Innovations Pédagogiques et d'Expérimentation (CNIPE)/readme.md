# CNIPE Internship Project - Conceptual Presentation
![Project Logo](./logo.jpg)
As part of my internship at **CNIPE (Centre National des Innovations Pédagogiques et de l'Expérimentation)**, I developed a detailed **project report** and **conception presentation** to illustrate the platform I built. The goal was to design a streamlined digital platform using **Flask** and **MongoDB**, integrating role-based controls for different stakeholders: Admin, Agent Postale, and Chef de Siège.

This document focuses not on the technical codebase, but on the conceptual and architectural presentation of the project.

## Structure Overview

Here's a breakdown of the project conception and reporting documents:

### Conception Directory
- **`conception/imgs`**: Contains the various diagrams and images used in the presentation.

### Demo Directory
Each subfolder in the `demo` directory contains screenshots and examples of the different sections of the platform:
- **`aide`**: Help section user interface.
- **`auth`**: Authentication pages including login and register.
- **`categorie`**: Category management page, role-specific.
- **`course & courseContent`**: Course and content management.
- **`espaceCategories`**: The space where categories are managed.
- **`gestionAdmins`**: Admin management panel for owners.
- **`home`**: Main dashboard home page.
- **`profile`**: User profiles for all stakeholders.

### Report Directory
- **`report/IMGS`**: Images used in the final report.
- **`report/pages`**: Contains detailed images for different pages of the platform such as:
  - **aide**, **category**, **courseContent**, **espace catégorie**, **gestionsAdmins**, **home**, **login**, **Mooc**, **profile**, and **register**.

### Presentation Directory
- **`presentation/english version`**: English version of the project presentation.
- **`presentation/french version`**: French version of the project presentation.
- **`presentation/imgs`**: Images used in both versions of the presentation.

## Features Demonstrated in the Report
- **Role-based access control**: Each user type (admin, agent postale, chef de siège) has specific functionalities displayed in the user interface.
- **Management of shipments**: The platform supports both Coles and Courier shipments.
- **Admin control panel**: Admins and owners have access to manage users, update tariffs, and view transaction logs.

## Next Steps
This report serves as a foundation for future improvements. Stay tuned for when the audiovisual division hosts the final platform, ensuring its availability for internal use across CNIPE.
